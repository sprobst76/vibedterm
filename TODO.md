# TODO

- Persist trusted host keys with optional device-level keystore caching to avoid repeated prompts across sessions.
- Wire terminal screen to xterm for interactive shells, including resize and Android extra-key row.
- Surface vault identities’ passphrases and agent support when connecting hosts.
- Add host-key trust list management UI (view/remove) and per-host fingerprints display.
- Root-level `flutter test` script via Melos to skip missing top-level tests gracefully.
